<h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing </h1>
<h2>Bettye Tish</h2>
<h3> For this map, I sought to answer the question: what areas of Atlanta, Georgia, 
    constitute food deserts? Very quickly in this process, I learned that a food 
desert must meet two qualifications: a high poverty area and no source of fresh food 
walking distance. For the purposes of my map, I went by <a href="https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/post/areas-concentrated-poverty">UC Davis' </a>measurement of 
"poverty areas" (areas with a poverty rate of more than 20%) and the commonly used 
<a href="https://www.dcla.net/blog/walkability-standards">urban planning measurement</a> of walking distance (1 mile, which is very generous). After
cleaning my data sets in QGIS using attribute table queries, I first created a buffer of
walking distance around local grocery stores. Then, I created a new layer using the difference
geoprocessing tool, finding areas that were both high poverty and not included in the walking distance
radius of grocery stores.
