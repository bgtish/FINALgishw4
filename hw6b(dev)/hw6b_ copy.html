<h1>Homework 6b: Census Data Chloropleth with Ratios </h1>
<h2>By: Bettye Tish</h2>
<h3>My Selected Ratio:</h3>
<h4>Each of the three maps below uses the same ratio: the number of 
    households in a county below the poverty line divided by the total 
    households in that county. This gives a sense of the concentration
    of poverty within a county, rather than just counting impoverished households.
    Without the use of this ratio, population centers such as Seattle would appear to have falsely
    inflated levels of poverty.
</h4>
<h3>1. Equal Count Classification Scheme</h3>
<h4>An advantage of this mode is the aesthetically pleasing appearance
    it creates, and clearly grouping similar counties together. A disadvantage
of this mode is that it exaggerates uniformity across an area. For example: all the dark
purple regions can only be grouped together by having a very large range within that data category.</h4>

<h3>2. Equal Interval Classification Scheme </h3>
<h4>An advantage of this mode is that it is easy to read and clearly expresses trends in a data set: the majority of counties have 
    low rates of poverty. However, a disadvantage of it is that exaggerates outliers in the data set: since only one
    count falls in the final range, it seems as though Washinton has low poverty rates.

 <h3>3. Natural Break Classification Scheme </h3>
 <h4>This mode is useful because it balances grouping data with accenuating the important
    differences in data. However, it would be less desirable in a data set with very similar values.
