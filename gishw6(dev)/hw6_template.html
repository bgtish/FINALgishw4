<h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Bettye Tish</h2>
<h3>This chloropleth shows the average annual household income throughout Washington State over five years (from 2016 to 2020). It utilizes data from the U.S. Census, which has been joined to a shapefile of Washington counties. The map is projected in the CRS NAD83 which is one of two UTM zones that the state falls in. I selected the color purple for the legend color gradient because it symbolizes wealth. </h3>
