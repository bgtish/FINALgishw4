<h1>Homework 7: Creating My Own Chloropleth </h1>
<h2>By: Bettye Tish</h2>
<h3> For this assignment, I chose to make a chloropleth showing the frequency of my
    favorite fast food restaurant across America. Any restaurant with tofu that good 
    deserves to be celebrated with a QGIS map!

    <div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="8480642" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1" data-width="40%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/i-love-chipotle-oh-my-god-gif-8480642">I Love Chipotle Oh My God GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/i+love+chipotle-gifs">I Love Chipotle GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

    The map was made using data from Statista, which
    I converted from a .XLSX to a .CSV file and cleaned. I chose to focus on the continental United States
    because there was no data for Alaska and Hawaii. I could have included these states but
    they would be challenging to see at this scale because of their extreme sizes. Including them
    would have made for a less aesthetically pleasing map. I used the natural breaks
    classification scheme to display my data because it emphasizes the natural
    groupings within the data without obscuring outliers. California was one such outlier, it 
    had 207 more Chipotles than the next state (Texas), for a grand total of 412 Chipotles. 
    Rightfully so, natural breaks classification assured that California had its own category. 
    In retrospect, this map could be improved by normalizing the data (perhaps Chipotles per person
    rather than numbers of Chipotle stores in each state) because it largely just reflects 
    population rather than a state's true preference for the American fast casual dining sweetheart Chiptole.
